  "text": "Dream Textbook is the product of over two decades of teaching students the ancient language of the \nQuran, but doing so in English. It was inspired by the unconventional yet effective the way I \nlearned the Arabic of the Quran and was able to organize a curriculum and teaching method \nthat showed unprecedented results by the grace of the Almighty. My students went on to become \nteachers themselves and they also made several enhancements and improvements to the \ncurriculum. I believe in this approach because I have seen first hand what it has done for \nthousands of students. It is, in my humble opinion, one of the most systematic and successful \ncurricula for the teaching of the Qurans language and based on what I've seen it accomplish, I and \nmy team hope to inspire students to be part of a worldwide effort of shortening the gap \nbetween the Ummah and direct access to their book in Allah's original words. Our vision is \nto provide this resource as a solid foundation for students, teachers and potential teachers and it \nis our hope that with this globally growing community we can create versions of this work \nadapted to languages from around the world so even people who don't have access to English \ncan benefit from this work. My prayers are with you, the student or the teacher, who make an \neffort to learn and teach Allah's words and I hope every step you take in this path brings you many \nsteps closer to guidance."
